### Sphericity of the Earth

**early proofs of the sphericity Earth**
1. The last part of a ship on the Horizon to vanish is his mast
2. Depending how far north or south you are the angle between a line pointing from your position to a certain star and a line pointing from your position to the zenith is greater or smaller.
3. Lunar Eclipse
  - round shadow of the earth on the moon during Lunar Eclipse


### Geoid

**Geoid**
- equipotential surface of the Earth’s gravity at sea level
- in case of the oceans
  - shape of the surface of the oceans, in case that only the Earth’s gravity and rotation would influence the shape (i.e., without taking other influences such as winds and tides into account)
- measured using satellites

### Ellipsoid

**Ellipsoid**
- An ellipsoid is a surface that may be obtained from a sphere by deforming it by means of directional scalings ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid))

**reference ellipsoid**
- a mathematically defined surface that approximates the geoid ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ellipsoid))
- World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84)
- Bessel 1841

**flattening**
- measure of how much the symmetry axis is compressed relative to the equatorial radius
- f = (a-b)/a
- inverse flattening 
  - 1/f

## Geodetic and Coordinate Reference Systems

**reference frame**
- reference points on the Earth and their corresponding coordinates

**geodetic reference system (GRS)**
- consists of
  1. reference ellipsoid
  2. the reference frame
- also called "datum""

**coordinate reference system (CRS)**
- consists of
  1. reference ellipsoid
  2. the reference frame
  3. [coordinate system](http//:kollektive-geographie-heidelberg.de/kartographie/03-coordinate-systems.html)
