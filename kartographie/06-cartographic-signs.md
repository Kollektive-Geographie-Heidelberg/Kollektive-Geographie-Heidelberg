## Seminotics

**Seminotics**
- Semiotics (also called semiotic studies) is the study of meaning-making, the study of sign process (semiosis) and meaningful communication ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics))

**semiotic triangle**
- also known as: triangle of meaning,  triangle of reference

## Taxonomy and Ontology 

**Taxonomy**
- the practice and science of classification ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(general)))
- formal and explicit classification
  - classes

**Ontology**
- <font color="#009933">formal</font> and <font color="#0033cc">explicit specification</font> of a shared <font color="#660066">conceptualization</font> ([Gruber 1993](http://tomgruber.org/writing/ontolingua-kaj-1993.pdf))
  - <font color="#009933">machine readable</font> ([Wolf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-04930-9_65.pdf))
  - <font color="#0033cc">concepts, properties relations, functions, constrains, axioms, are explicitly defined</font> ([Wolf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-04930-9_65.pdf))
  - <font color="#cc00cc">abstract model and simplified view of some phenomenon in the world tat we want to represent</font> ([Wolf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-04930-9_65.pdf))
  - classes
  - relations

**figuratively**
- Data (Visual variables) + Ontology = Information


## Scales of Measurement

Scales of measurement refer to ways in which variables/numbers are defined and categorized. Each scale of measurement has certain properties which in turn determines the appropriateness for use of certain statistical analyses. ([Webster](http://faculty.webster.edu/woolflm/statwhatis.html))

| Scale | Operator | Central Tendency |
| ----- | -------- | -----------------|
| Nominal | =, =! (Difference) | Mode |
| Ordinal | >, < (Direction of Difference) | Median |
| Numerical (Interval) | +, - (Amount of Difference) | Mean, Deviation |
| Numerical (Ratio) | \*, / (Absolute Zero) | Geometric Mean, Coeff. of Variation |

- Ordinal has also all properties of Nominal
- Interval has also all properties of Ordinal
- Ratio has also all properties of Interval

## Types of colour palettes

- categorial (nominal)
- sequential (ordinal, numerical)
- diverging (ordinal, numerical)


## Cartographic Signs

- point symbol
- linear symbol
- areal symbol


### Visual analogies and associativity

**Iconic symbols**
- symbol -> feature class
- meaning by visual associativity to a class of features

**Iconographic symbols**
- symbol -> feature
- meaning by visual associativity to only one feature


### Mental analogies and associativity

**symbolic sign**
- meaning by visual associativity, though only to a part of the meaning of one feature or a class of features

**indexical sign**
- meaning by context

**conventional sign**
- meaning by convention

**assigned sign**
- meaning by visual associativity, though only to a part of the 

**(structural referencing)**
- relation between objections correlates to relations between map symbols


### Spatial structure

...


## Topology

### Egenhofer Relations

- A disjoint B
- A contains B
- A inside B
- A equals B
- A touches B
- A covers B
- A is covered by B
- A overlaps B


## Learning Objectives

- Semiotic triangle
- Ontologies and taxonomies
- Scales of measurement
- Many types of cartographic signs
- How can and why do we relate map elements to reality?
- Structural referencing is important!
