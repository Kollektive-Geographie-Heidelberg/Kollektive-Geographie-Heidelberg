# Interactivity

**Why is interactivity important?**
- The size of the screen is limited
- In static maps, only one scale can be used
- When too much information is shown, maps become complicated to read
- Maps only represent two dimensions
  - time is left out

**Interactivity modes**
- Pan
  - move the map face by dragging it
  -  shows new areas while hiding previously shown ones
- Zoom
  - change the scale of the map, either by using buttons, or two fingers
- Time slider
  - shows the map or the depicted data at different points in time
- Magnifying glass
  - magnifying glass shows the area around the cursor at a larger scale
- Selecting map elements
  - a map element can often be selected by hovering it
  - map elements can be selected, either to depict their spatial extent, or to provide further information
- Layers
  - layers contain different thematic information
  - layers can often be displayed on top of each other
- There exist far more techniques for interactivity!
