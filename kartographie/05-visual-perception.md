# Visual Perception

Visual Perception is deceivable and individual different (e.g. color blindness). If you make something visual perceptible than you have to take this in account.

## Gestalt Psychology

A major aspect of Gestalt psychology is that it implies that the mind understands external stimuli as whole rather than the sum of their parts. The wholes are structured and organized using grouping laws. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology))


### Gestalt Laws

The fundamental principle of gestalt perception is the law of prÃ¤gnanz, which says that we tend to order our experience in a manner that is regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simple. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology))

**Law of Proximity**
- The law of proximity states that when an individual perceives an assortment of objects they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a group ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology))

**Law of Similarity**
- The law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology))

**Law of Closure**
- The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology))

**Law of Symmetry**
- The law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts. Therefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent shape. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology))

**Law of Common Fate**
- The law of common fate states that objects are perceived as lines that move along the smoothest path ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology))

**Law of Continuity**
- The law of continuity states that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology))

**Law of Good Gestalt**
- The law of good gestalt explains that elements of objects tend to be perceptually grouped together if they form a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology))

**Law of Past Experience**
- The law of past experience implies that under some circumstances visual stimuli are categorized according to past experience ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology))

## Preattentive processing

> When shown an image, there are some visual properties that we can detect effortlessly and almost instantaneously - they "pop out."
>
> These are called preattentive attributes.
>
> Knowing which attributes are preattentive can help in creating more effective visualizations. 
>
> ~ Brad Lyon: https://learnforeverlearn.com/preattentive/

**why is preattentive processing of importance?**
- browse the map
- recognize important features
- navigate from A to B
- make a map comprehensible across cultures and when being rotated, etc.
