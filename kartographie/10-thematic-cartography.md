# Thematic Maps

**thematic map**
- a map that exposes the following characteristics:
  - a phenomenon is displayed, being of interest independently of the actual map
  - the actual map is used to provide context to this phenomenon

## Characteristics

Thematic maps are very diverse, even for maps of the same scales in respect to:
- use of visual variables
- generalization
- complexity
- potentially distortion
- freedom of design


## Classification

- topic of the phenomenon to be depicted
- technique used for the visualization of the phenomenon
  - dot map, areal map, etc.
- characteristics of the phenomenon to be visualized
  - qualitative vs quantitive maps
  - static vs dynamic maps
- number and interrelation of the visualized phenomena
  - analytic map
    - 1 variable
  - complex map
    - \> 1 causally related variables
      - e.g. evaporation and temperature
  - synthetic map
    - use f more than 1 possibly not causally related variables
- scale
- basis map vs derived map 
  - thematic information included during its collection 
  - vs.
  - thematic information already stored in some database

## Mapping Method's

### dot map

-  dot distribution map, or dot density map
-  map type that uses a dot symbol to show the presence of a feature or a phenomenon. Dot maps rely on a visual scatter to show spatial pattern. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_distribution_map#cite_note-1)

### choropleth map

- Choro + pleth = area + value
- Value applied to area

### isoline map

- shows continuous surface
- interpolation is applied to points of known values to create lines of eqaul attribute values

### cartogram

- Varies areal size in proportion to magnitude of values
- The geometry or space of the map is distorted in order to convey the information of this alternate variable ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartogram))

### areal distribution map

- shows how areas with certain features (values) are distributed over a larger area (map)


### Other Mapping Method's
- vector map
- diagram map
- etc.

## Planning

- Which purpose shall the map have?
- Which information and which attributes are of interest?
- Which projection, which scale, and which area shall be depicted?
- Which visualization technique is ideal for conveying the information?
- Do all elements of the map reflect this purpose if possible?

## Rules of thumb

- background in gray, foreground with colours
- unimportant information in the background, important information in he foreground
- no use of highly saturated colours, because this allows for adding another “layer” on top
- keep the visualization as simple as possible, and as complex as necessary

## Learning Objectives

- Definition of a thematic map
- Classification schemes for thematic maps
- Visualization techniques
- Tools
- Information visualization
