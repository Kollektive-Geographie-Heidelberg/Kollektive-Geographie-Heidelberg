# Thematic Maps

**thematic map**
- a map that exposes the following characteristics:
  - a phenomenon is displayed, being of interest independently of the actual map
  - the actual map is used to provide context to this phenomenon

## Characteristics

Thematic maps are very diverse, even for maps of the same scales in respect to:
- use of visual variables
- generalization
- complexity
- potentially distortion
- freedom of design


## Classification

- topic of the phenomenon to be depicted
- technique used for the visualization of the phenomenon
  - dot map, areal map, etc.
- characteristics of the phenomenon to be visualized
  - qualitative vs quantitive maps
  - static vs dynamic maps
- number and interrelation of the visualized phenomena
  - analytic map
  - complex map
  - synthetic map
- scale
- basis map 
  - thematic information included during its collection 
  - vs. 
  - derived map thematic information already stored in some database

## Mapping Method's

- dot map
- areal map
- choropleth map
- cartogram
- isoline map
- vector map
- diagram map
- etc.

## Planning

- Which purpose shall the map have?
- Which information and which attributes are of interest?
- Which projection, which scale, and which area shall be depicted?
- Which visualization technique is ideal for conveying the information?
- Do all elements of the map reflect this purpose if possible?

## Rules of thumb

- background in gray, foreground with colours
- unimportant information in the background, important information in he foreground
- no use of highly saturated colours, because this allows for adding another “layer” on top
- keep the visualization as simple as possible, and as complex as necessary

## Learning Objectives

- Definition of a thematic map
- Classification schemes for thematic maps
- Visualization techniques
- Tools
- Information visualization
