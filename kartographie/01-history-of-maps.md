# The History of Maps

> “A map is not the territory.”

## Terms

**cartography**
- The art, science and technology of making and using maps. (International Cartographic Association 2003)

**models**
-  ...

**why models?**
- Reality is often, at least in its entirety, not tangible
  - You cannot be in NYC and in Chicago at the same time!
  - You cannot physically go back in time!
- Properties of the real world stay often invisible
  - One cannot ‘touch’ or ‘see’ the concepts ‘hometown’ or ‘number of inhabitants’
- There are far more features in the real world than we could understand at the same
  - Need to emphasize certain features or properties

**map**
- A map is a graphic representation of a part of the surface of the Earth (or another planet) that exposes the following characteristics (Wolfgang Scharfe)
  - has a scale
  - generalized
  - georeferenced
  - uses symbols to encode information
  - annotated with textual explanations
  - representation in the plane [german: verebnet]
  - planimetric

**map-related representations**
- …


## Protohistory (prehistroy - 600 BC)


## Classical antiquity (600 BC – 600 AD)

**gazetteer**
- geographisches Ortsverzeichnis


## Middle Ages (500 - 1500)

**mappa mundi**

- Relapse to schematic representations/illustrations
- Loss of projections but still cardinal directions
- Depiction of thematic information
  - bible story, mythology
  - history
  - flora, fauna
- Complete world
- Common between 700 and 1500

**portolano**
- related to ports or harbors
- a collection of sailing directions

**portolan chart**
- navigational maps based on compass directions and estimated distances observed ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portolan_chart))
- 13th–15th century
- Mostly created in Italy, Catalan, Portugal, Arab world
- striving anew for better maps due to demand by seafaring
- navigational aid is a rhumbline/ windrose network

**rhumbline/ windrose network**
- 16 windroses distributed on a circle
- 16 (or 32) straight lines of bearing (‘rhumblines’) for each of these windroses
- lines for the eight main directions (‘winds’) in black
- lines for the eight intermediate directions of the winds (‘half-winds’) in green
- lines for the 16 intermediate directions of the half-winds (‘quarter-winds’) in red

## Age of Discorvery (1400 - 1770)

**Technological innovation**
- stronomy: better computations of ephemerides
- Navigation: ephemerides could be used for geolocation
- Shipbuilding

Seafaring over long distances became possible!
Need for good maps to travel around over the sea, and need for unknown areas to be mapped!


### (Cartographic) innovation 1

**triangulation (1671)**
- …

**plane table (1550?)**
- …

**new print technologies**

> First extensive and modern atlases
> Emergence of regional cartography due to wish for large-scale maps


### Cartographic innovation 2

- more abstract depiction
- emergence of signatures
- emergence of isolines (for example, to depict depth of water)


## Early modern period (1400 - ca. 1850)

**Age of Discovery (1400 – 1770)**

**Thereafter**
- barometric altimetry – air pressure used to determine elevation
- precise measurements about the figure of the Earth (size, shape,
oblateness)
- introduction of the prime meridian (Greenwich)
- use of new projections
- use of embankment hachures and shading hachures


## Late modern period (ca. 1850 - now)
- terrestrial and aerial photogrammetry
- national surveying agencies
- cartography as a scientific discipline
- shaded reliefs and isolines very common
- offset printing

**since ca. 1980s**
- broad acceptance of computers
- use of databases
- Geographical Information System (GIS)
