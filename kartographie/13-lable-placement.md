# Label Placement

**Why to use labels in maps?**
- names and other complex information otherwise hard do convey
- semantics is, in most cases, already known

**Why not to use labels in maps?**
- labels harder to read than cartographic signs
- reading labels takes longer than reading cartographic signs (preattentive processing not possible)

**What to use labels for?**
- Names
  - New York City, Heidelberg, Mühltalstraße
- Descriptions
  - Kleine Höhle, Schutzhütte
- Abbreviations and acronyms
  - A 1, B 225
- Numbers
  - Hausnummern, Höhenangaben
- ...


## Toponym

**toponym**
- name for a geographical entity

**endonym**
- name only used at the place of the geographical entity
  - London, Москва, Heidelberg

**exonym**
- name only used outside the place of the geographical entity
  - Londres (french), Moskau (german), 海海德堡 (mandarin


## How to Choose the Typographic Variables?

**Freedom of design**
- What is the intended use of the map?
- Which general design principles are used in the map?
- Which message is intended to be conveyed?

**General rules of thumb**
- It becomes easier to discriminate between labels and background, if both differ in brightness, saturation, and hue. Black is often an ideal choice.
- Water is often represented by a blue area and labels in darker blue. In case of very extensive water bodies, white labels can be a good choice.
- Labels should not be smaller than about 6pt in printed maps, and not smaller than about 9pt on screen.
- Too many differences in topographic variables on one map sheet confuses the map reader.

**Rule of thumb**
- physical features
  - serif
- cultural features
  - sans serif

| nominal scale | ordinal scale |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| type family | font size |
| regular/italic | capitalization |
| colour hue | font wight |
| tracking | colour brightness |


## Label placement

- label in proximity to the corresponding map sign (helps associating the label to the map sign)
- labels can uniquely be related to the map signs (helps associating the label to the map sign)
- label horizontally oriented (easy to read without the need of turning your head)
- labels not overlapping (hard to impossible to read the labels otherwise)
- labels not on top of other map elements (other map elements are otherwise hard to read)
- labels equally distributed in the map (improves general readability and appearance of the map)

**Label placement in case of point symbols**
- suitable distance to the labelled map sign
- preferred positions: right and above

**Label placement in case of linear symbols**
- suitable distance to the labelled map sign
- preferred positions: left and above
- parallel aligned to the labelled map sign
- potentially: repeated use of the label
- potentially: tracking

**Label placement in case of areal symbols**
- placed inside the labelled area
- placed in the centre of gravity (for square-sized areas)
- placed along the main axis (for long areas)
- fill the area: font size, tracking


## Learning Objectives

- why are labels used in a map?
- toponyms, endonyms, exonyms
- high number and diversity of typographic variables
